## Tree Data Structure

Tree data structure is a collection of data (Node) which is organized in hierarchical structure recursively

### Basic Terminologies of Tree

-   root node - the first node of the tree
-   leaf node - the nodes which does not have any child nodes
-   edges - the connecting link between any two nodes
-   parent node - the node which is a predecessor of any node
-   child node - the node which is descendant of any node
-   sibling nodes - the nodes which belong to same Parent
-   internal node - the node which has atleast one child
-   degree - the total number of children of a node

### Applications of Tree Data Structure

-   To represnt hierarchical data
    -   organizational structure
    -   folder structure
    -   xml/html content (json objects)
    -   In OOPS (inheritance)
-   Binary Search Tree
-   Binary Heap
-   B & B+ trees in DBMS
-   Spanning and shortest path tree in Computer Networks
-   Parse trees and expression trees in compilers

### Variations of Tree

-   Trie
-   Suffix Tree
-   Binary Index tree
-   Segment Tree
